FORT BOYARD GAME
Contributors : Theo SIDOROK, Gregoire DARGENT, Florian ANTAO

This project is a simplified version of the tv show "Fort Boyard", containing maths challenges, logic challenge, chance challenge, riddles and a final challenge corresponding to the tv show.
This program is really intuitive and is fast to play, it is made so everyone can use it, you can create a team and play different characters that you choose for different challenges.
It only contains python programs (with the random and json libraries) and some JSON files used as a data.
You can just dowload the zip of this repository and open it with any editor supporting python like VisualStudio or PyCharm
After this, just run the program normally without doing anything more, then write in the console to keep going.

These repository contains the following algorithms :
    - main.py (Theo S.)
    - utility_function.py (Theo S.)
    - chance_challenges.py (Florian A. and Theo S.)
    - final_challenge.py (Theo S.)
    - logic_challenges.py (Gregoire D. and Theo S.)
    - math_challenges.py (Theo S.)
    - pere_fouras_challenge.py (Theo S.)

Every algorithms containing the "challenge" mention in its name is a part of the game, the utility_function.py is here to make the game cohesive and bring functionalities such as the creation of a team, the choices of players etc...
Most of the input and error management is made out of some try/except loops, the presence of errors in this project is not completely excluded.

Enjoy!
